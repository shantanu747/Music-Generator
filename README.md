To run our program, git clone this repo and go to the Client/ directory. Our software will run locally on your computer without the need for a server.


Then to run the client make sure you have npm installed in your computer.

In the Client directory on the command-line do:

npm install
npm start

That way npm runs a local server, and will automatically start the program.
