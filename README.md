Music Generator

For SD&D we have the client side built. 

First clone our repo.

Then to run the client, you need to navigate to the Client folder, and make sure you have npm in your computer.

In the Client directory on the command-line do:

npm install
npm start

That way npm runs a local server, and will automatically start the program.
